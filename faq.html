    <h2>Getting Started</h2>

    <h3>How do we start?</h3>
    <p>
      Send a request using our contact form. We’ll review the details and recommend the best next step —
      often starting with remote support or an IT Health Check.
    </p>

    <h3>Do you offer an IT Health Check?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. Many clients start with an IT Health Check to identify risks, gaps, and priorities before making changes.
      It’s a structured way to plan upgrades, security, backups, and infrastructure decisions.
    </p>

    <h3>Do you support home users too?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. We support home users and small businesses. If your request is business-related, choose “Small Business”
      in the form so we can respond appropriately.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Remote vs On-Site</h2>

    <h3>Do you provide remote support?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. Many issues can be resolved remotely, which is usually faster and more cost-effective.
      We’ll recommend remote support when it makes sense.
    </p>

    <h3>When is on-site support required?</h3>
    <p>
      On-site service is typically needed for hardware installs, physical network work, cabling, Wi-Fi access point placement,
      and issues that can’t be reproduced remotely.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="highlight">
    <h2>Billing & Scope</h2>

    <h3>Do you bill hourly?</h3>
    <p>
      Most support work is billed hourly unless a project scope is defined in advance. We keep scope clear and avoid surprises.
    </p>

    <h3>Do you offer fixed-price projects?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, for clearly defined services (for example: migrations, new PC setups, or network installs). We’ll confirm the scope
      and expectations before starting.
    </p>

    <h3>Will you start work without approval?</h3>
    <p>
      No. If additional work is needed outside the original request, we discuss it before proceeding.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Microsoft 365, Email & Domains</h2>

    <h3>Can you set up professional email with our domain?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. We can configure business email and domain settings using Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace, depending on your needs.
    </p>

    <h3>Can you migrate email from another provider?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. We handle email migrations with a focus on minimizing downtime and validating mail flow after the move.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="highlight">
    <h2>Windows 11 & New PC Setup</h2>

    <h3>Can you check if our computers can upgrade to Windows 11?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. We offer Windows 11 compatibility assessments so you can plan upgrades or replacements before Windows 10 end of support.
    </p>

    <h3>Do you set up new computers and move data?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. We can set up new PCs and migrate approved user data so your team can work immediately.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Backups & Security</h2>

    <h3>Do you set up backups?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. We can set up and verify backups (cloud, local, or hybrid) and document what’s protected.
      Ongoing monitoring and recovery testing can be added if needed.
    </p>

    <h3>Will you ask for passwords?</h3>
    <p>
      No. Please do not send passwords by email or through the website form.
      If access is required, we’ll use a secure method and you remain in control.
    </p>

    <h3>How do you handle remote access?</h3>
    <p>
      Remote sessions are performed with your permission and can be ended by you at any time. We aim for least-privilege access
      and use temporary access wherever possible.
